# React Portfolio

React.js app created by me to present a simple, minimalistic developer portfolio.
Components and styles are set up to be as reusable as possible for easy forks.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

### `npm run eject`

### `npm run build` fails to minify

### `npm run predeploy`

Runs `npm run build` which will build the app

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app on github pages according to configs in `package.json`.
This includes `"homepage"` property.
